# vim-setup

For use with vim 8 plus only as it works with the vim 8 package manager.

## Install

```
mkdir ~/.vim/pack
touch ~/.vimrc
git clone git@github.com:kennylavender/vim-setup.git ~/.vim/pack/vim-setup
npm install -g typescript
```

That should be it.

TypeScript is required for the ale plugin to do linting and other syntax based stuff.
